Hi all!

Thanks for shortliating me for this written interview. The answers to the asked questions are below.


1 . in high school or university, what did you achieve that you consider exceptional?

 My university was not a good one. To be more precise students were more interested in art than tech even those studying engineering.
I founded the coding club of our university and went on to host a global coding competition which had participants from over 10 countries.
This was the first competition of its kind in my university. I also mentored juniors and even now sometimes go back to college to talk 
on tech.

2. what makes for an ideal devops engineering colleague?

I have good experince with kubernetes and docker during my time at Redhat as a software engineer. But to be homest I am a junior engineer with 
only 1YOE I am looking to learn and grow as well.

3.what are the key trends in infra-as-code?
ans:
kubernetes

git-ops

vulnebrality analysis

4. what could be improved in the state of the art of devops?

better telemetry and logging

5. how familiar are you with Linux operations - including networking and storage - and how did you gain this experience?

Not very familiar.
I have understanding of docker networking storage but not very familiar with linux networking.


6. describe your Python software engineering skill, and how did you gain this experience?

I have developed core customer facing highly scalable apis in python during my time at redhat.
i also owned the api-server for my team at Redhat.


7.why does this particular opportunity interest you?

I feel this will be a good opportunity for me to learn and grow as an engineer. One of the most important things for growth is culture and i have heard good things about canonical.


8.how are you involved in open source software?

I have contibuted to major projects like Quay, clair, cliarcore , CRDA.

9.how do you think Canonical could improve Ubuntu and its cloud offerings?

I have used ubuntu but that was some timer ago.
I always wanted the gnome desktop but that already happened so cant add anything here.

I do not have enough knowledge about your cloud offering to comment on how you would improve it.

10.what do you think are the most significant strengths of Canonical's competitors?

I feel REdhat openshift and VM Tanzu are the competitors that will be bit hard to overcome since they have been in the industry for a much longer time.


11 what about your personality and interests makes you a great potential member of this team?

I am always eager to learn and explore. New things excite me. I have mentored 3 interns during my time at redhat and all of them got converted to full time employees.
I am lucky to say most of my colleagues think of me as friend and not just a professional partner.


12.what about Canonical interests you the most?

Most importantly the work culture.
opensource tech.
